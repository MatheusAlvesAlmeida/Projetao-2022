## Install

### (Optional) Create a Conda Environment

If you have Conda installed, we highly recommend you to create a new environment for usage, to avoid any library conflicts.
To do so, just run `conda create --name UBSbot python=3.9` and finish the environment creation.
About the Python version, there's no recommended version, the 3.9 it's just an example.
After creating the environment, run `conda activate UBSbot` to start the environment.
